-- SUMMARY --

The signage install profile creates an organic groups-based digital signage
website. The project relies heavily on the ctools/page manager/panelizer suite
of tools and provides some defaults for those projects as features.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Download and install drush: http://drupal.org/project/drush.
Run the following command:
drush make http://lb.cm/mGF signage --prepare-install --working-copy

to download everything (core, the signage profile, contrib modules & libraries)
into a folder called 'signage'.

Install the site as usual, using 'Signage' as the site's profile.
